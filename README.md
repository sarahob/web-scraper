Web scraper which scrapes the videos of YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/graciehinabox/videos">Grace Helbig</a> to get the ids and titles of each video and then writes them to a JSON file.

The app then uses the JSON file to randomly play a video. Because I don't know! (if you're a Grace fan you totally get that, if not, this is probably awkward...!)

This app was just a bit of fun to play around with NodeJS and web scraping!
